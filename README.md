# Brute Force Monty Hall Problem Solver

This is a simple program that solves the Monty Hall problem by using brute
force. Please remember to use a large enough number (preferably >100.000) if
you want to see real results.

## Compilation

After clonning the repository, create a build folder at the root of it. This folder will contain all output from the compilation.

Compilation has been done through gcc on a Debian 10 machine, simply running make should get everything compiled.

## Execution

Running the compiled ./build/game will run the Monty Hall game 1.000.000 automatically and output the results unto the console.

./build/game -h for more options.
